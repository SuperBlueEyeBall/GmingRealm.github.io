            <h1 id="gimkit-cheat">Gimkit h4cks Tutorial</h1>
            <p>This version of Gimkit Cheat was inspired by Gimkit Utility by <a
                    href="https://github.com/UndercoverGoose">UndercoverGoose</a>, which was sadly taken down. The main
                things that were carried over from the other script are using Typescript, Rollup and Tampermonkey, which
                makes it easier to develop and use.</p>
            <h1 id="how-to-install">How to install</h1>
            <p>Install/Update it by clicking on <a
                    href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheLazySquid/GimkitCheat/main/build/bundle.user.js">this
                    link</a> while having a <a href="#how-to-get-a-userscript-manager">userscript manager</a> installed
                on your browser.</p>
            <h2 id="how-to-get-a-userscript-manager">How to get a userscript manager</h2>
            <h3 id="option-1-tampermoney">Option 1: Tampermoney</h3>
            <p>Simply go to the <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/index.php?browser=chrome">Official Tampermonkey
                    Download Page</a>, select your browser on the second top row, and follow the instructions on how to
                install it for your browser down below.</p>
            <h3 id="option-2-what-if-tampermonkey-is-disabled-in-the-extension-store">Option 2: What If Tampermonkey is
                disabled in the extension store?</h3>
            <p>There is an easy fix for that! <a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/">Tampermonkey</a> is by far the
                most popular userscript manager, but you can use others one if you want or if Tampermonkey is
                blocked/disabled. For example, I also use <a
                    href="https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/">Violentmonkey</a> as you can’t use Tampermonkey in a
                mobile browser such as kiwi browser.</p>
            <h1 id="disclaimers-important">Disclaimers (important)</h1>
            <h2 id="disclaimer-for-chromebooks-users">Disclaimer for Chromebooks users</h2>
            <p>The GimKit h4cks work fine on high quality computers such as windows operating systems on computers in a
                computer science class. If you use these on a chromebook, it will likey be very laggy and you may not
                even be able to enter the game. Please continue reading on the <a href="#read-this-for-all-devices">next
                    sub-page</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="read-this-for-all-devices">Read this for all devices</h2>
            <p>It is sometimes hard to join a game and have it register. If you want to have a higher change of being
                able to join, then type in your name as quick as possible and press join. Make sure you copy the join
                URL or just refresh as the h4cks will have already loaded in.</p>
            <h1 id="features">Features</h1>
            <p>Gimkit Cheat provides a nice, unified way to use different cheats. To open/close the hud, press “\”
                (backslash) on your keyboard while on Gimkit. It will show various menus, which should be fairly self
                explanatory. If you find any issues, please open a new <a
                    href="https://github.com/TheLazySquid/GimkitCheat/issues/new">issue</a> on this repository.</p>
