### Welcome to Gmingrealm, the best gaming site on the market!


This project has a license, so don't try copying it. You can fork it and give credit without claiming it's yours. Self-hosting and hosting providers are OK ***WITH CREDIT AND LICENSE*** of me (SuperBlueEyeball) and the template creator (SipSup3314). 

## My backstory 

I used to have this gaming site hosted on replit, but it run on replit which sucks now. Replit also got blocked in my school. The site even got resource limited so I took initiative after a while and restarted the best gaming site ever!!!

## Features

This site has a few features to make your life easier:
- Tab Hider (Opens tab in about:blank. Not visible to <em>some</em> extensions such as GoGuardian)
- Homepage is disguised as Google
>(We may add more options in the settings to change stuff like this in the future.

## Requests / Ideas / Bugs

To make a game request or review the site, please [make an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/shadowgmes/shadowgmes.github.io/issues/new/choose) or [tell us in our feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdU1CELhxTF7WqrW2ujKs9DHI1gANNJQqzN7Ojz6i8sIe-X6A/viewform?usp=sf_link).

&nbsp;<h4><em>There are limitations to the games we can add.</em></h4>
- Only browser games. Please don't ask for Fortnite or Roblox.
- No online multiplayer games. Since the multiplayer servers for games can and will be blocked for most people, we cannot do online multiplayer.
- No unlocking websites or streaming services. Once again, we are broke and can't afford servers. 

## Pull requests

Pull requests are highly encouraged as they take work off our hands and allow people to contribute to this site.

> A pull request means you provide the solution to the problem you are telling us about. For example, a simple pull request could be that on line 133, a word is misspelled, so edit the code yourself to fix the misspelled word, and send in that pull request. It provides us with all added, modified, and removed lines of code. <em>Dont be adding in some sneaky viruses or something.</em> **Everything** is reviewed before commiting and pushing.
